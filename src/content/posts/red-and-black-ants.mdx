I recently came across a post that went something like this:

> Keep a 100 red ants and a 100 black ants in a jar and nothing will happen. But if you shake the jar hard, the red and the black ants start killing each other. The enemy is neither the red ant, nor the black ant, but the one who shook the jar.

A nice message, especially considering the state of the world today. People in positions of power, the ones holding the jar, simply need to “shake the jar” -- on topics like religion, politics, or even sports -- and suddenly the red and black ants are ready to fight. What a clever way to control the ants and distract them from real issues: hunger, safety, psychological crisis, etc. If the ants were more aware, they could solve these problems. Hunger and safety are easily achievable goals if they cooperate instead of compete. But then, the ones shaking the jar would lose control, wouldn’t they? So they keep shaking -- ensuring the ants are too busy fighting and struggling for basics so that they never get a chance to think clearly. Once an ant falls into conflict, it becomes trapped -- like a well that’s easy to fall into but hard to climb out of. Hope and entertainment are other ways of keeping the ants distracted.

In the last 2,500 years, there have been 0 known years in which the world was completely free of war. Even if the author’s data is wrong and there were 100 years free of war out of 2500 years, it doesn’t change the point -- Human beings, currently, are violent creatures, though we may not like admitting it. Violence begins in the mind, physical violence is simply the outward manifestation. The outward violence in the world is a reflection of the inward violence within the Human Being. Condemnation, judgement etc are violent acts, though mental. Haven’t you noticed it within yourself? We can eliminate outward violence only when the inward violence is eliminated -- not the other way round.

The question then is, is it possible for human beings to be free of violence?
How is one to approach this question? Usually human beings, on seeing the violence within themselves, create the opposite and say, “I will be non-violent”. Sounds good, doesn’t work. The fact is that one is violent. The non-fact, the what should be, is the idea that one should be non-violent. There is conflict between “what is” and “what should be”. This conflict is part of violence. So saying “I must be non-violent” is the continuation of the pattern of violence. Its the same with saying I will not be afraid or I will not be greedy or I will not be sad. Violence is saying that it will become non-violent. Violence cannot become non-violent, because it is violence. Non-violence is the absence of violence. Its exactly like when an engineer investigates why a certain piece of code is not working as expected. They don’t begin by saying it will work properly in the future -- it won’t. The engineer starts with observation - They try to see what’s actually going on. When they see exactly, clearly, what’s going on, the solution presents itself. One need not go searching for the solution, it lies hidden in the problem itself.

Let’s get a tiny bit nerdy -- I promise it’ll be worth it! Imagine I want to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. So I write this little piece of code:
```
function calculateSum() {
  let sum = 0;                     // Start by initializing sum to 0
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { // Loop i from 1 to 100
    sum = sum + i;                 // Add i to the sum 
    i = i + 1;                     // increment i by 1
  }
  return sum;
}
console.log(calculateSum());       // Output: 2500 (should be 5050)
```
Now, clearly something’s off -- the result is 2500 instead of 5050. How do we fix it? Not by hoping the code will magically correct itself! Saying “I’ll become non-violent” is like expecting this code to fix itself -- it won’t. So, how does a good engineer approach this? By calmly observing what’s happening, step by step -- no judgment, no frustration, just awareness. Let’s look at what the code does:

The sum starts at 0, and i starts at 1.
Add i to the sum → 0 + 1 = 1.
Then we increase i by 1 → i = 2.
At the end of the loop, i++ runs automatically -- meaning i becomes 3 before the next round starts.
Aha! We’ve been adding 1, 3, 5, 7… instead of every number. ‘i’ was jumping two steps at a time because we incremented it twice -- once in the loop body and once in the loop declaration. Now look what has happened, in this simple act of observing, the solution has revealed itself -- remove one of the increments, and everything falls into place.

Thought is the reaction of memory as knowledge. The past, memory, is continually modifying itself through the present, but at any given moment, it is the past which is static. Since thought is reaction of memory, it is also static. Thought is never creative. Let’s say you prefer coffee over tea based on your past experiences with them. Someone asks you, what do you like, Coffee or Tea? If you are honest, your answer will always be Coffee, until and unless you come across some kind of tea that you like more, right?

***Thought, like code, follows a set pattern; it’s mechanical.***

I encourage the reader to pause here for some time to digest all this before continuing. Instead of writing the aforementioned every time, henceforth, I’ll use a symbol, “ ¤ ” to indicate that the author feels this is a good time to pause. Of course, its just a suggestion -- you are free to do as you wish.

The human brain, having evolved over millions of years, works in the same pattern in all human beings. It’s the same brain that the Indian, the American, and the Japanese have, though they would probably not like hearing this. The human brain has evolved over millions of years; America was created about 250 years ago. No particular brain has fallen from the sky to be considered special. The author is aware that there are gradations in intellect, but is also aware that each brain has the capacity to unclog itself and attain a clear intellect unless it has completely gone off track. Then, it may need some external aid.

At the risk of sounding repetitive, I’d like to remind the reader that we are doing all this because we want the answer to our original question: is it possible for human beings to be free of violence?
There must be a sense of urgency. This is not mere entertainment. The question HAS to be answered, otherwise, one will continue to live in violence and sorrow till one dies. If one is fine living that way, that’s alright. The author absolutely, irrevocably refuses to live that way ¤

Since no brain has fallen from the sky, it is sufficient to observe a particular brain to understand how the human brain works in general. This act of observation itself reveals the solution as seen above. The scientist, like the engineer, looks, observes to understand what’s going on. But he chooses to study the brain from the outside -- Using MRI scans, EEGs to analyse brain waves etc, which is fine, but it is a very long and impossible journey, if one wants complete understanding, as shown in the following paragraphs.

First, let us investigate and understand what is involved in observing the brain externally:
What goes on in the brain, in your brain?
Thoughts and emotions, right?

That which one observes as thoughts and emotions internally, are observed as certain patterns externally in MRI Scans and EEG Brain wave graphs.

What one observes externally using MRI scans etc, is the visual representation of the same process that goes on internally. Secondly, the visual representation is limited by the very equipment one uses to observe the brain. Currently, as far as the author knows, Science recognises 5 types of brain waves. What if there are more which are not detected by our current equipment? Alternatively, what if the equipment we have was able to detect only 4 types of brain waves -- We wouldn’t have known that a fifth type exists! What we can observe externally, is limited and is translated according to the equipment we use. No matter how sophisticated it gets, the representation will always be partial and incomplete. Not only that, it is a translation of the actual. Thoughts and emotions translated and shown visually using equipment look like MRI Scans and Brain wave graphs. One can also translate the electrical signals measured by the EEG into audio -- That would be the auditory representation of the signals captured by EEG. The easiest method by far to study the brain is to just observe it directly. Just observe what goes on in one’s own mind! So then the question that we wanted to answer simplifies from “is it possible for human beings to be free of violence?” to “is it possible for me to be free of violence?” because you too are a human being ¤

This should give us enough reason to discard the approach of observing the brain externally. Why does Science continue to probe the brain externally? Why hasn’t Science tried exploring the brain inwardly? I can think of 3 reasons:

1. There is no obvious reward.
Humans will go to the moon for fame or power, but few see value in understanding themselves. One isn’t going to get any wealth or recognition by doing this, so why bother? There is nothing to gain.
I think it’s the opposite -- there is nothing to lose, and everything to gain.

2. Science demands proof for verification.
How can one prove that which one has observed internally? And how is someone else to verify it? What if one was lying? Science demands concrete, external proof -- Subjective claims are not enough for verification purposes.
Well, if someone wants to verify the claims, they can just observe themselves, but it is not easy.

3. Observation demands energy and passion.
Ultimately, it involves watching one’s every thought and emotion so that nothing goes by unobserved. This is what “meditators” try to do -- Close one’s eyes and observe one’s thoughts and emotions. Most people don’t do it for more than a few minutes. The author is saying that one must be aware of every thought and emotion. I use the word “meditation” within quotes because contrary to popular belief, it is not an activity brought about through an act of the will -- meditation happens naturally as the brain is cleared. To clear the brain, first of all, one must be aware of the muck. Therefore, one starts by watching one’s thoughts. There is another difficulty involved in all this. Its one thing to be aware of something external to you, let’s say an ant, objectively. But if one has tried observing one’s own thoughts, one would have noticed how difficult it is to observe objectively, to not get carried away in them, and to watch without judgement and condemnation. Usually one identifies with the thoughts and gets lost in them and then suddenly after some time one remembers that one had to “meditate”, right? All of this demands energy and passion.

We still haven’t answered our question though: is it possible for me to be free of violence? I’m sorry but I’ll have to leave you guys on a cliffhanger! In the meantime, I invite you to sit with this question. Sure, the author will share his thoughts in the upcoming posts, but if you come across the answer on your own, it is then your truth, not someone else’s truth. Having said that though, ultimately truth is truth, it doesn’t belong to anyone, and that’s the beauty of it.
