Human beings often judge their own worth - and that of others - based on their *accumulations*: their bank balance, car, house, memories, experiences, and the knowledge they've gathered. When I say "they", I'm referring to humanity as a whole, not anyone personally - and of course I do not exclude myself from this. These aforementioned accumulations are wholly psychological - they may have a physical reality underlying it as is in the case of one's car, but "my car" is a psychological accumulation, isn't it? Other accumulations may be completely psychological without any physical basis like in the case where one has an imaginary argument with someone about some topic and acts from that.

Because everyone has accumulated some knowledge, especially when it comes to psychological matters, and because nobody knows what they don't know, everyone thinks they know. Since people take pride in what they know, when someone else begins to speak, there's resistance to truly listen. Isn't there also that constant urge to speak - to express an opinion, sensible or not - just so one doesn't feel inferior?

So it's important to ask: **Why does the author speak at all?**
What is the author's motive in writing this blog? Is it to show off knowledge, to feel validated in some way? And if that isn't the author's motive, then why not simply remain silent - as he often does anyways?

So, the first thing I wish to make clear, as a kind of disclaimer, is that I neither consider myself superior nor inferior to anyone. I mean this sincerely. I don't feel superior to the beggar on the street, nor inferior to Elon Musk or anyone else. Because judgement and comparison simply don't exist in the field of love. When you see a puppy wagging its tail, eager to play with you, do you think, "I'm so much smarter, so superior to this puppy"? Of course not! It sounds ridiculous! A puppy is a puppy and you are you. Neither is superior or inferior. Sure, your intellect may be better than that of the puppy, but that doesn't make you superior to the puppy.

So again we return to the question, what's my motive in writing this blog? As strange as it may sound, I speak - or in this case, write - without any motive. There is neither the desire to appear superior, nor the urge to "help," because who am I to help another in these matters? Lets investigate a bit more: Action without a motive - what kind of action is that? Action with a motive, by its very nature, is selfish. The motive is of the self, of the "me" that wants or doesn't want something. Action without a motive, then, must be self-less action, isn't it? Surely, that is the action of love, isn't it? If I say to someone, "I love you because…" - and add any reason you like - then it isn't truly love, is it? Because wherever there is a reason, there is a motive. And where there is motive, love cannot be.

So when I speak about these psychological or spiritual matters, I probably speak out of compassion. Because human beings, wherever we are, we suffer. The poor who cannot afford food suffer. The pious suffer. The rich suffer, because nothing in this world is permanent, and there is always the endless drive to accumulate more - to "become better." This idea of "becoming better" takes many forms, and when one cannot fulfil it, one suffers. There are countless people who seem to have everything - no visible lack, no apparent reason for sorrow - and yet they end their lives. Of course, I am aware that I also am imperfect like almost every other human being. Vanity, Desire, Fear etc affect me too. Having said that though, for me its of utmost importance that I not let any personal biases affect my investigation for truth is all important, not my personal opinion. So lets just say, though not perfect, I'm trying my best like everyone else.

The second topic that needs some clarification is the source of the author's understanding. Is it some philosophy or some theory that he is promoting? The author has no spiritual authority - not from any religion, guru, or any other entity. Some of you may know I've read certain books or listened to certain people online, so you might think I'm repeating their ideas. But that's like saying my understanding that (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b² belongs to my math teacher, Mrs. Margaret, just because she first showed me how to expand it. I don't accept that. Because I've verified it for myself, by seeing that it's true and not merely believing her words, the understanding is mine. I'm grateful to her, of course, but she's not my authority.

In the same way, what I share is my own understanding. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. It's more like this: Suppose you and your friend are driving somewhere, and you notice on Google Maps that there's a shorter route. You say, "Hey, look, there's a shorter way." That's all that the author is trying to do. The friend can look if they're interested - perhaps the road actually is shorter (or maybe not!)- or they can think, "I've lived here longer, I know the roads better. There's no need for me to look." It's entirely up to them.

Even though it may appear that only I'm speaking, we're actually exploring together. It's not me speaking and you listening, which would be meaningless. How, then, can one truly understand what another is trying to convey - not just hear the words but to actually go beyond them, to truly grasp the entirety of what's being said? It's possible only if one is equally interested, equally passionate about the topic being discussed, isn't it? In other words, both the people must be "in sync" or "zoned in", which does not mean merely agreeing to what the other is saying. When did we understand a topic best in the classroom? Wasn't it when we were most interested and therefore listened actively, passionately?

So in life, it's important to listen completely - to at least suspend if not eliminate judgement until the speaker has finished. Only then can one fully grasp what's being said. Once one has understood what the speaker wants to convey, one can do whatever one wishes with it. Keep it if it resonates, or discard it if it doesn't - It does not matter. What matters is understanding what's being conveyed without distortion - listening without any personal bias. Otherwise, what's the point of anyone speaking, and anyone else listening?
