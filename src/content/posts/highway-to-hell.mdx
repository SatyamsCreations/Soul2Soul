An amazing quote which I came across recently is:

> “The road to hell is paved with good intentions”

Huh?!?!

Yes.

You may know that there is a group of people, called the “Flat Earthers,” who are often the subject of ridicule because they believe that the Earth is flat and that governments are trying to trick them into believing that it is round. I feel that their assumption is very natural though. They look all around themselves and find, guess what, flat ground! They go to the beach and see the ocean stretching as far as one can see. As a matter of fact, historically, for a long time, human beings did not believe in the current model of the cosmos — It’s a very recent thing considering how long we have been on this planet. Anyone who advocated the current understanding of the cosmos would have been termed either a lunatic or a heretic by people. 

Now, compare the flat earther’s belief to some of the beliefs that are accepted by society today. Most people in the world are “religious”, but they don’t even know whom or what they are worshiping. They inevitably end up worshipping some *symbol* and believe that to be the sacred. The word symbol here encompasses all that is worshipped in the world currently. Isn’t *this* much more ridiculous than the Flat Earther’s belief? If one worships, one should at least know the entity that one is worshipping, right? *Symbols become important when one loses touch with the actual.* One *thinks* that a symbol is sacred and worships it. I can *think* that I am a unicorn, but that doesn’t make me a unicorn — That makes me deluded.

***All belief is delusional.*** One believes in something only when one does not know it to be true. Does one need to believe that (a+b)² is equal to a² + 2ab + b²? No, because one can multiply and check for oneself, so one *knows* it to be true — There is no need to believe. Another person comes along, and let’s say they do not know algebra. Some person having some authority tells them (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Now, this equation is true for one person and confusing for the other. The other neither knows it to be true, nor knows it to be false. Therefore, they are in a state of confusion. Since the other is confused and because they are afraid of judgement from authority and society, they believe it to be true. Learning algebra is difficult, believing is much easier; it’s the easy way out. Then, to validate themselves, they go about judging other people who do not know the equation, and this cycle continues. See what has happened: Only the first person knew the equation to be true, the rest are all in a state of confusion. The rest have memorized the equation and in the process, forgotten or distorted some of it but still believe it to be true. When this continues over thousands of generations, the socially accepted equation becomes (a+b)² = pqr + xyz + k¹⁰ + e²³⁸ ¤

Some statements are easy to verify, others not so much. The above one is reasonably easy. Others, like Fermat’s last theorem are not, at least that’s what the author has heard from mathematicians. Fermat’s last theorem looks easy, it says:

>There are no positive integers x, y, z such that  
>x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup>  
>for any integer n > 2.

The saga of this theorem is quite fascinating, and the curious reader can search online to know more. There are many resources which describe it in easy to understand terms. Long story short though, it took 358 years for mathematicians to prove it to be true. Andrew Wiles, the person who proved it, worked on it for almost 7 years, almost in complete secrecy. Wiles’s proof spans about 200 pages in total. Each line is packed with intricate reasoning and layers of abstraction. Mathematicians often say that reading it — and truly understanding it — can take *months* even for experts in the field. It’s not just a proof of a theorem — it involved the creation of an entire mathematical framework.

Some statements just require effort to be ascertained to be true or false. It’s not necessary that one must go about ascertaining the truth of every statement — One can do so if one is interested. If not, one can leave it and say, *"I do not know."* That’s totally fine, but one doesn’t want to do that either, because of pride, fear of judgement from society, etc. So one enters into the field of belief, which implies living in delusion. Insecurity is a natural consequence of a belief. One doesn’t know it to be true and has yet identified themselves with it, so when another questions it, one doesn’t like it. It reminds me of the following quote that I once read, I’m paraphrasing:

>Truth doesn’t mind being questioned; Belief does not like being challenged ¤

Now, one who has eaten an apple may write a 1000 pages about the taste of an apple, but how does it help a person who has never eaten it? Can a person who has never eaten an apple know what it tastes like from reading the description? Sure, it gives an *idea,* but the description is not the fact. The idea is a mental abstraction, whereas the taste of an apple is *that.* A person cannot understand the fact from the description of it. Only when a person eats an apple can they know what it tastes like. Only then can they understand the description. So, the description, the symbol, is not important, only the actual is.

One can understand where the the Flat Earther’s belief stems from as shown earlier. However, despite multiple experiments, photos and videos from the International Space Station, and even an experiment which they themselves devised in 2018 to prove that the earth is flat which ironically ended up showing that the earth is round, the Flat Earthers still *cling* to their belief. They absolutely refuse to let go, calling all the evidence a hoax. *Why?* Remember, all brains work in the same pattern. We’re taking the example of the Flat Earther because most people know that their belief is incorrect. Also, the Flat Earthers won’t try to beat the author up unlike some other groups. As I write this post, I’m starting to like them more and more! Coming back to the question, why does the Flat Earther absolutely refuse to give up their belief? Is it because the belief is all that they have and all that they are? In other words, the belief has become their identity, “I am a flat earther”. If I am a flat earther, anyone who questions my belief will be perceived by me as an attack on me, right? Also, if that belief were not there, what would I be? I would be nothing, right? And one is afraid of being nothing. Because right from childhood, everyone has always said you must be something. You must become a “big” person. That’s just another way of saying that one must get a good position in this society, the higher the better, though the society may be completely corrupt and immoral.

The way one becomes *something* is by identifying oneself with something, usually with what one perceives to be something great. Like saying I am a Republican or a Democrat or a BJP supporter or a Congress supporter. Finally, the greatest thing available for identification is God, so one identifies with various gods that one has created, saying, “So-and-so is my god”. Consider the case of football fans: One becomes a Messi supporter or a Ronaldo supporter because they are the “best” players and then one fights endlessly with the other. This is because the existence of the other is a threat to one’s belief that their favourite player is the best, therefore a threat to themselves, because one has identified themselves with that belief. It is simple — If I am a Messi fan, and another person comes and says Messi is not good, Ronaldo is better, this is an attack on me, right?

***Identification with anything distorts perception.*** A Messi supporter cannot see the amazing machine-like physical capabilities that Ronaldo possesses and the Ronaldo fan cannot see the magician that Messi is. Expecting outward change without inward change is pointless, like the massive anti-corruption protests in 2013 in India which ended up doing nothing, though the Lokpal bill was passed. The only revolution that can bring about a change in the world is the revolution in the psyche of the human being. Its not evolution, in the sense of the past modifying itself and becoming better. Its a complete and total revolution without the interference of the past.

Identification, by its very nature, creates an ***artificial division*** among human beings. Lets say I identify with a belief that the earth is flat, so I become a flat earther. The consequence of this act is that I have created an artificial division, a duality, in the mind — The Flat Earthers and the non-Flat Earthers. The ‘We’ and the ‘They’. Where there is division, there will be conflict, right? Look at the divisions currently present within the society — they are artificial, caused by people identifying themselves with all kinds of stuff: Other people, Books, Ideas, Sects, Birthplaces, Languages, Skin colours, Bank balances, Jobs, Football teams, Surnames, Political Parties and so on.

>Identification is “Evil”

I hesitate to use the word evil, because as we saw, the intentions weren’t “evil” at all. It’s just that one is confused and doesn’t see that identification is a highway that leads to hell.
